This was a winning project that I did at Pasadena City College for Pi Day 2014.  

I was initially interested in modeling Felix Baumgartnerâ€™s fall as an excuse to 
play around with the double integral equation for acceleration due to gravity.  
Luckily, my differential equations professor pointed out to me that the more interesting
problem was modeling free fall in the presence of quadratic drag and variable air 
density and that in light of the drag, the nominal difference in acceleration due to 
height above earth is completely moot.
